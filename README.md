**NOTE: This game was refactored and not re-done from scratch, even though a good arquitecture would require it, to face the fact that when working with a team, refactoring has to be done on top of what collegues have built.**

## Description

*MultiPlayer Cyber-Battle* is an exciting TPS game using Unity's Photon Network. Done following a tutorial. The game has only one level, but it includes three different gameplays:

- **Kill Count:** See who can kill more players in a time limit.
- **No Respawn:** See who is the last man standing.
- **Team Battle:** Two teams fight each other to see who can kill more players of the opposing team in a time limit.



## Key Features

- **Refactored Codebase:** Improved code organization and performance, ensuring a smoother and more maintainable experience.
- **Dynamic Damage Feedback:** Added a blood splatter effect on the screen whenever the player takes damage, providing immediate visual feedback. As the playerâ€™s health decreases, the screen margins gradually turn red, intensifying the sense of danger and urgency as they near critical health levels.

## Example of Refactoring in Player Manager

To illustrate a feature of refactoring in this game, consider the following C# code that keeps track of the player state:

```csharp
public class PlayerManager : MonoBehaviourPunCallbacks{
	private void SetPlayerDeadState(bool isDead){
		gameObject.GetComponent<WeaponManager>().isDead = isDead;
		gameObject.GetComponentInChildren<AimLookAtRef>().isDead = isDead;
		gameObject.layer = (isDead)?LayerMask.NameToLayer("Ignore Raycast") : LayerMask.NameToLayer("Default");
	}
}
```

## Example of Unity Event usage in SpawnManager

To illustrate a feature of our game, consider the following C# code:

```csharp
public class SpawnManager : MonoBehaviour{
    private void OnEnable(){
        WeaponManager.OnNoWeaponsFound += SpawnWeaponStart;
    }
    private void OnDisable(){
        WeaponManager.OnNoWeaponsFound -= SpawnWeaponStart;
    }

private void SpawnWeaponStart()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < weapons.Length; i++)
        {
            PhotonNetwork.Instantiate(weapons[i].name, weaponSpawnPoints[i].position, weaponSpawnPoints[i].rotation);
        }
    }
}
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
